Privacy Policy for Minimalist Task Manager

This Privacy Policy describes how the Minimalist Task Manager Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and stores your information.
We Do Not Collect Your Personal Data.
The Minimalist Task Manager Extension is designed with your privacy in mind. It operates entirely locally within your Chrome browser and does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) about you.

Data Collected and Stored Locally:
The Extension stores the following information directly within your Chrome browser's local storage (chrome.storage.sync):
•	Your Tasks: The text, completion status, creation date, and starred status of the tasks you add to the "Today's Tasks" and "Weekly Tasks" lists.
•	Custom AI Tools: The labels and URLs of any custom AI tool buttons you add.
•	Dark Mode Preference: Your preference for enabling or disabling dark mode.
•	Daily Background Index: An index used to cycle through background gradients daily.

This data is stored locally on your device and is synced across your signed-in Chrome browsers using Chrome's built-in synchronization feature. This allows your tasks and settings to be available on different devices where you use the Extension.

How Your Data is Used:
The data stored locally is used solely for the functionality of the Extension:
•	To display and manage your tasks.
•	To provide quick access to your saved AI tools.
•	To apply your chosen dark mode setting.
•	To display the correct daily background gradient.

Your Data is Not Shared:
The Extension does not send, share, or transmit any of your task data, custom tool information, preferences, or any other data stored locally to any external servers, third parties, or the developer of the Extension.

Data Retention:
Your data is retained locally within your Chrome browser's storage as long as the Extension is installed. If you uninstall the Extension, the data stored via chrome.storage.sync associated with the Extension will be removed from your browser and Chrome's sync storage.

Changes to This Privacy Policy:
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the Privacy Policy page on the Chrome Web Store listing and potentially through updates to the Extension itself. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through the support link provided on the Chrome Web Store listing page for the Minimalist Task Manager Extension.
